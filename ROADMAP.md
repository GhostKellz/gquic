# GQUIC Development Roadmap

## Current Status: ⚠️ Pre-Alpha (Compilation Issues)

### Phase 1: Core Stability (2 weeks)
**Goal: Get the library compiling and basic QUIC working**

#### Critical Fixes Needed:
1. **Type System Issues**
   - Fix `ConnectionId` serialization (bytes crate serde integration)
   - Fix borrowing issues in scheduler and frame handling
   - Add missing `Clone`/`Debug` traits where needed

2. **Core Protocol Implementation**
   - Complete packet encoding/decoding
   - Fix frame processing pipeline
   - Implement proper error types with structured errors

3. **Stream Management**
   - Fix BiStream/UniStream async traits
   - Complete connection accept patterns
   - Implement proper flow control

#### Key Files to Fix First:
- `src/quic/connection.rs` - Fix ConnectionId serialization
- `src/quic/frame.rs` - Fix protocol error types
- `src/quic/stream.rs` - Complete AsyncRead/AsyncWrite implementations
- `src/quic/scheduler.rs` - Fix borrowing conflicts
- `src/crypto/rustls_backend.rs` - Fix Ring integration

### Phase 2: HTTP/3 Implementation (3-4 weeks)
**Goal: Add complete HTTP/3 support over QUIC**

#### New Modules Needed:
1. **HTTP/3 Protocol Layer**
   ```
   src/http3/
   ├── mod.rs           # Main HTTP/3 interface
   ├── connection.rs    # HTTP/3 connection management
   ├── stream.rs        # HTTP/3 request/response streams
   ├── frame.rs         # HTTP/3 frame types (DATA, HEADERS, etc.)
   ├── qpack/           # QPACK header compression
   │   ├── mod.rs
   │   ├── encoder.rs
   │   ├── decoder.rs
   │   └── table.rs
   ├── headers.rs       # HTTP header handling
   ├── request.rs       # HTTP request types
   ├── response.rs      # HTTP response types
   └── server.rs        # HTTP/3 server implementation
   ```

2. **Integration Points**
   - HTTP/3 over existing QUIC streams
   - ALPN negotiation ("h3")
   - Connection upgrade handling

#### HTTP/3 Features to Implement:
- [x] QPACK header compression/decompression
- [x] HTTP/3 frame parsing (DATA, HEADERS, SETTINGS, etc.)
- [x] Request/response multiplexing
- [x] Server push support
- [x] Flow control integration with QUIC
- [x] Error handling and stream reset

### Phase 3: Production Readiness (2-3 weeks)
**Goal: Make it production-ready with performance optimizations**

#### Performance Optimizations:
1. **Zero-Copy Optimizations**
   - Buffer management improvements
   - Direct packet processing
   - Memory pool for connection objects

2. **Concurrency Improvements**
   - Lock-free data structures where possible
   - Better async task scheduling
   - Connection-level parallelism

3. **Protocol Optimizations**
   - 0-RTT support completion
   - Connection migration
   - Advanced congestion control (BBR, CUBIC)

#### Monitoring & Observability:
- Complete metrics implementation
- Distributed tracing integration
- Performance profiling hooks
- Connection health monitoring

### Phase 4: HTTP/3 Advanced Features (1-2 weeks)
**Goal: Add advanced HTTP/3 capabilities**

#### Advanced HTTP/3:
1. **Server Push**
   - Push promise handling
   - Cache validation
   - Resource prioritization

2. **Advanced QPACK**
   - Dynamic table optimization
   - Header field reordering
   - Memory-efficient compression

3. **HTTP/3 Extensions**
   - WebTransport support
   - Extended CONNECT method
   - Custom frame types

## Technical Debt & Quality
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite (unit + integration)
- [ ] Benchmarking suite vs. Quinn, hyper, etc.
- [ ] Documentation generation
- [ ] Example applications
- [ ] Security audit preparation

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Compiles without warnings
- [ ] Passes RFC 9000 (QUIC) compliance tests  
- [ ] Passes RFC 9114 (HTTP/3) compliance tests
- [ ] Performance within 10% of Quinn for basic operations
- [ ] Memory usage under 50MB for 1000 concurrent connections
- [ ] Successfully serves HTTP/3 traffic in production

## Dependencies to Add
```toml
# HTTP/3 specific
httparse = "1.8"           # HTTP parsing utilities
http = "1.0"               # HTTP types and headers
indexmap = "2.0"           # Ordered maps for QPACK
flate2 = "1.0"             # Compression utilities

# Performance
ahash = "0.8"              # Fast hashing
smallvec = "1.11"          # Stack-allocated vectors
tinyvec = "1.6"            # Tiny vectors

# Testing & Benchmarks
criterion = "0.5"          # Benchmarking
quickcheck = "1.0"         # Property testing
tokio-test = "0.4"         # Async testing utilities
```

## Risk Assessment
**High Risk**: Current compilation failures prevent any testing
**Medium Risk**: HTTP/3 implementation complexity 
**Low Risk**: Integration with existing GhostChain ecosystem

## Next Immediate Actions
1. Fix the 53 compilation errors (start with type system issues)
2. Create minimal working QUIC client/server example
3. Add HTTP/3 module structure
4. Implement basic HTTP/3 frame handling
5. Add integration tests
